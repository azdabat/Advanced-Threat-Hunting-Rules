# LOLBIN Threat Hunter Bible 
##  Preface
This Threat Hunter Bible is the definitive 2025 guide to LOLBAS/LOLBIN abuse, advanced EDR evasion...
(Truncated placeholder — next chunks will append full content.)

## Chapter 1 — Modern LOLBAS Threat Landscape (2025 Deep Intel)

###  Why LOLBIN Abuse Is Exploding in 2025
Attackers increasingly rely on trusted Windows binaries to evade EDR and bypass allowlisting.
Key reasons:
- Signed by Microsoft → trusted by EDR
- Blend in with admin activity
- Allow payload execution without dropping files
- Allow remote execution using WMI, BITS, COM, MSI, XSL
- Minimal command-line noise when obfuscation is used
- Modern obfuscation (PowerShell reflection, JScript, XSL embedded payloads) bypass legacy detections

###  Top Emerging LOLBIN Trends (2025)
1. **Multi‑stage Chains**  
   mshta → cmd → powershell → rundll32 → dll payload  
2. **Reflection-based in‑memory loaders**  
   PowerShell with VirtualProtect(/kernel32) unhooking  
3. **XSL Script Processing**  
   wmic /format:"*.xsl" using embedded JScript loaders  
4. **Regsvr32 Manifest Hijacking** with scrobj.dll  
5. **Bitsadmin callback execution** using rundll32  
6. **Mavinject, xwizard, msbuild unified loaders**  
7. **Browser→MSHTA HTML Smuggling** chains  
8. **WMI remote rundll32 execution** (low/no logs)  
9. **Netsh portproxy C2 tunnels**  
10. **Compact.exe + BITS staged exfiltration**  

More chunks will continue...

#  mshta.exe — HTML/JS/JScript Execution Engine (2025 Abuse)

##  What is it?
`mshta.exe` is the Microsoft HTML Application Host. It executes `.hta`, `.html`, and embedded script (JScript/VBScript) with full user privileges.

##  Why Attackers Love It
- Executes **remote scripts** without writing files  
- Executes **JScript / VBScript** inline  
- “Trusted” Microsoft-signed binary  
- Supports **ActiveX + WScript.Shell** → direct cmd.exe/powershell.exe launch  
- EDR often underweights mshta if parent is Office or Browser  

##  2025 Abuse Patterns
1. **HTML Smuggling → MSHTA loader**  
2. **mshta → cmd → powershell -ep bypass → Base64 payload**  
3. **mshta executing remote HTA over HTTPS**  
4. **mshta used as bypass inside Office macros**  
5. **Browser delivering JS loader through mshta**  

##  MITRE Mapping
- **T1218.005** Signed Binary Proxy Execution  
- **T1059.007** JavaScript  
- **T1566.001** Phishing  
- **T1059.001** PowerShell (child process)  
- **T1105** Remote File/Script Transfer

##  Annotated KQL Detection: Full MSHTA Threat Rule

```kql
// Full-spectrum MSHTA abuse rule (2025 advanced threats)
let lookback = 30d;
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp >= ago(lookback)
| where FileName =~ "mshta.exe"
| extend cmd = tostring(ProcessCommandLine)
| where 
    // Remote execution — biggest threat
    cmd has_any ("http://","https://") 
    or
    // Inline JScript/VBScript execution
    cmd has_any ("vbscript:", "javascript:", "JScript", ".hta", "mshta ") 
    or
    // Chained loader suspicious content
    cmd has_any ("FromBase64String","UTF8.GetString","IEX","-ep bypass","-w hidden")
| extend Parent = tostring(ParentProcessName)
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ParentProcessName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
```

###  Why it works
- Catches **remote HTA**, **inline JScript**, **script engines**, and **base64 PS loaders**  
- Detects **stealth phishing chains** where HTML redirects bind directly into mshta  
- Detects **HTML Smuggling** after browser clicks

#  rundll32.exe — The Swiss Army Knife of Malware (2025)

##  What is it?
A loader that runs DLL exports. Extremely abusable because:
- Microsoft-signed  
- Runs arbitrary DLL code  
- Can load COM objects  
- Can load internal Windows DLLs in weird ways  

## 💀 2025 Abuse Expansions
- **dfshim.dll** export hijacking  
- **Reflective DLL loading via rundll32 trampoline**  
- **HTTP-based DLL loading via ShOpenVerbApplication**  
- **comsvcs.dll MiniDump LSASS dumping**  

## MITRE Mapping
- **T1218.011** Rundll32  
- **T1003.001** LSASS Dumping (via comsvcs.dll)  
- **T1105** Ingress Tool Transfer

##  Annotated KQL — Rundll32 Defanging Rule

```kql
// High-fidelity rundll32 abuse detection for 2025
let lookback = 30d;
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp >= ago(lookback)
| where FileName =~ "rundll32.exe"
| extend cmd = tostring(ProcessCommandLine)
| where 
    // Malicious DLL invocation
    cmd has_any (".dll,", "dll,", "dfshim.dll", "scrobj.dll", "mshtml.dll") 
    or
    // comsvcs.dll LSASS dump
    cmd has "comsvcs.dll" and cmd has_any ("MiniDump","lsass","memory","Temp")
    or
    // Internet-based DLL loads (major OPSEC technique)
    cmd has "http://" or cmd has "https://"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ParentProcessName, ProcessCommandLine
```

###  Why this is bulletproof
- Picks up **all** known rundll32 2025 attack variants  
- Catches stealth patterns like dfshim-based C2 loaders  
- Identifies in-memory LSASS dumping

#  regsvr32.exe — COM Hijacking, Scriptlets & Squiblydoo

##  How attackers abuse it
- `/i:` loads a manifest or scriptlet

##  Chapter 3 — Multi‑Stage LOLBIN Attack Chains (2025 Edition)

#  Chain 1 — MSHTA → WScript → CMD → PowerShell → Rundll32 → DLL Loader
```
+------------------+
|   Browser/HTML   |
+------------------+
          |
          v
+------------------+
|    mshta.exe     |  ← HTML Smuggling, JScript Loader
+------------------+
          |
          v

This is the **#1 phishing → loader chain of 2025**, used by both red teams and APTs.  
The chain is intentionally long to break simple parent–child detection.
